      <p><b>Abstract:</b> We are in the midst of a major data revolution. The total data generated by humans from the dawn of civilization until the turn of the new millennium is now being generated every other day. Driven by a wide range of data-intensive devices and applications, this growth is expected to continue its astonishing march, and fuel the development of new and larger data centers. In order to exploit the low-cost services offered by these resource-rich data centers, application developers are pushing computing and storage away from the end-devices and instead deeper into the data-centers. Hence, the end-users' experience is now dependent on the performance of the algorithms used for data retrieval, and job scheduling within the data-centers. In particular, providing low-latency services are critically important to the end-user experience for a wide variety of applications.</p>
      <p>Our goal has been to develop the analytical foundations and practical methodologies to enable solutions that result in low-latency services. In this talk, I will focus on our efforts on reducing the latency through load balancing in large-scale data center systems. We will develop simple implementable schemes that achieve the optimal delay performance when the load of the network is very large. In particular we will show that very simple schemes that use an adaptive threshold for load balancing can achieve excellent delay performance even with minimum message overhead. We will begin our discussion that focuses on a single load balancer and then extend the work to a multi-load balancer scenario, where each load balancer needs to operate independently of the others to minimize the communication between them. In this setting we will show that estimation errors can actually be used to our advantage to prevent local hot spots. We will conclude with a list of interesting open questions that merit future investigations.</p>

      <p><b>Abstract:</b> This talk will provide an overview of the COSMOS testbed (www.cosmos-lab.org), that is being deployed as part of the NSF Platforms for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR) program, and the supported experiments in advanced wireless, millimeter-wave (mmWave), full-duplex, edge cloud, and optical networking. COSMOS (Cloud-Enhanced Open Software-Defined Mobile-Wireless Testbed for City-Scale Deployment) is being deployed in West Harlem (New York City) by Rutgers, Columbia, and NYU in partnership with NYC, CCNY, U. Arizona, IBM, and Silicon Harlem. It targets the technology “sweet spot” of ultra-high bandwidth and ultra-low latency, a capability that will enable a broad new class of applications including augmented/virtual reality and cloud-based autonomous vehicles. Realization of such high bandwidth/low latency wireless applications involves research not only on radio links, but also on the system as a whole including algorithmic aspects related to spectrum use, networking, and edge computing. </p>
      <p>We will present an overview of COSMOS’ key enabling technologies, which include mmWave radios, software-defined radios, optical/SDN x-haul network, and edge cloud, followed by the deployment and outreach efforts. We will then describe our recently conducted extensive 28 GHz channel measurement campaign including over 40 million power measurements collected from over 2,600 links on 22 sidewalks in 4 different sites. We will also describe experiments on open-access full-duplex wireless and converged optical-wireless x-haul networking with edge cloud that we conducted in the COSMOS testbed.</p>
      <p>The COSMOS testbed design and deployment is joint work with the COSMOS team (www.cosmos-lab.org). The mmWave measurement results are based on joint work with Manav Kohli, Tianyi Dai, Angel Daniel Estigarribia (Columbia), Tingjun Chen (Duke), Rodolfo Feick (UTFSM), Dmitry Chizhik, Jinfeng Du, and Reinaldo A. Valenzuela (Nokia Bell Labs). The full-duplex results are based on joint work with Tingjun Chen (Duke), Mahmood Baraani Dastjerdi, Manav Kohli, and Harish Krishnaswamy (Columbia).</p>

     <p><b>Abstract:</b> Personal data collection typically starts on user devices, in a range of application domains including the web, mobile, Internet-of-Things, smart TV, and virtual reality. Many useful services are enabled by the collection of personal data, although increasingly at the expense of privacy, security, transparency, and fairness, for individuals and for the society as a whole. To deal with these problems, technical solutions are currently being developed to provide privacy guarantees and/or to expose data collection by various players in the data tracking ecosystem. Increased public awareness has also led to recent legislation on data protection, such as GDPR and CCPA, and policy has become a powerful tool to be used in synergy with technology. </p>
      <p>In this talk, I will first describe the landscape of personal data collection and tracking today. I will then present our approach, which leverages the network as a universal vantage point for auditing the data collection practices of application developers as well as of various platforms. We develop tools for intercepting and inspecting traffic at the edge of the network, and we analyze the network traffic to look for exposures of personal data. We also check the consistency of network traffic with the corresponding privacy policies and eventually the compliance with data protection laws. I will argue that, going forward, the design of devices, software and networks needs to incorporate privacy-by-design, rather than be treated as an afterthought.</p>
